This is just a fun little project, that turns any picture into a histogram.

You can drop your images directly onto the website, and it will work in
"screensaver" mode, automatically playing images.

All computations happen in your browser, and images are never uploaded anywhere.

You can also paste images directly from the clipboard.

Note: Due to security restrictions, we can play only CORS-enabled images.

Images from imgur.com or wikipedia can be animated, while images from pinterest
cannot.
